# Sliding Window

## Concept
Used to find subarrays with certain properties (sum, max, distinct elements).

## Patterns
- Fixed window size
- Variable window size (expand + contract)

## Common Problems
- Maximum sum subarray of size k
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Minimum window substring

## Notes
- For variable windows, track extra condition (like char counts)
