# DSA Practice

This repo is my structured practice ground for Data Structures and Algorithms. It's tailored to prep for ML/AI/Research Engineer interviews with focused effort and solid fundamentals.

## Structure

- `algorithms/` — Core algorithm types (graphs, sorting, searching)
- `data_structures/` — Arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.
- `problem_set/` — My solved Leetcode/other problems
- `notes/` — Concept notes & patterns (Markdown)
- `ref_repos/` — External references (gitignored)

## Goals

- Refresh essential DSA topics
- Practice Leetcode with problem patterns
- Build a personal knowledge base of key concepts
- Focus on patterns over problem count

## Progress Tracker
