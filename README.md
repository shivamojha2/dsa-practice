# DSA Practice

This repo is my structured practice ground for Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Structure

- `algorithms/` â€” Core algorithm types (graphs, sorting, searching)
- `data_structures/` â€” Arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.
- `notes/` â€” Concept notes & patterns (Markdown)
- `ref_repos/` â€” External references (gitignored)

## Goals

- Refresh essential DSA topics
- Practice Leetcode with problem patterns
- Build a personal knowledge base of key concepts
- Focus on patterns over problem count

## Progress Tracker

| Topic            | Notes | Practice |
|------------------|:-----:|:--------:|
| Arrays           |  ðŸ”„   |   ðŸ”„     |
| Hashing          |  ðŸ”œ   |   â¬œ     |
| Sliding Window   |  ðŸ”„   |   ðŸ”„     |
| Linked Lists     |  ðŸ”œ   |   â¬œ     |
| Trees            |  ðŸ”œ   |   â¬œ     |
| Graphs           |  ðŸ”„   |   â¬œ     |
| Searching/Sorting|  ðŸ”œ   |   â¬œ     |
| DP               |  ðŸ”œ   |   â¬œ     |

ðŸŸ¢ `âœ…` = Notes written  
ðŸ”„ = In progress  
ðŸ”œ = Coming soon  
â¬œ = Yet to start
